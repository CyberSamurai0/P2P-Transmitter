# Point to Point Laser Transmission built using C
## Abstract
This project implements a full-duplex, wireless, point-to-point communication channel across free space using laser diodes, programmed entirely in C.

Each endpoint utilizes a Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040 microcontroller to manage data transmission and reception via a from-scratch implementation of UART. All required hardware components are listed [here](https://github.com/CyberSamurai0/P2P-Transmitter/wiki/Hardware-Setup).

## [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/CyberSamurai0/P2P-Transmitter/wiki)
Documentation on how to implement this project is available on the repository's **[Wiki](https://github.com/CyberSamurai0/P2P-Transmitter/wiki)**.
