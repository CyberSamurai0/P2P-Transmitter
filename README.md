# Point to Point Infrared Data Transmission built using C
## Abstract
This project aims to implement wireless point-to-point data transmission using laser diodes, programmed entirely in C. Each endpoint utilizes a Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040 microcontroller to manage data transmission and reception. 

## Quick Start
Documentation on how to implement this project is available on the repository's **[Wiki](https://github.com/CyberSamurai0/P2P-Transmitter/wiki)**.
